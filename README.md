### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently learning softwares, but my focus for now is product design, ux and interfaces.

  <h4>I'm Janine and I graduate in journalism and had an mba/especialist in art direction.</h2>
   <h6>I had a carreer in design since university and have been done projects that help companies grow your communication and design teams.


Open âœ¨ janinelopes.com.br âœ¨ to check UX Design projects.


Here are some funny things about my job:
- I graduate with journalism but I wont work with news
- I work with design since 2014, and product design since 2020
- Now I'm trying to complicate my polemic lab learning softwares
