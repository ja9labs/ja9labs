### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently learning programming, but my focus for now is user experience, branding and interfaces.

  <h4>I'm Janine and I graduate in journalism and had an mba/especialist in art direction.</h2>
   <h6>I had a carreer in design since university and have been done projects that help companies grow your communication and design teams.


Open âœ¨ ja9labs.myportfolio.com âœ¨ to check UX Design projects.


Here are some funny things about my job:
- I'm journalist but I don't like news on tv
- Some day I woke up and I was a product designer and now I'm trying to complicate my polemic lab
